# Kaggle-Competitions

### Description

The repo has the code from the Kaggle competitions that I took part in. The folders are named after the competitions, and within each folder, you will find the corresponding code. The data is handled, cleaned, and prepared for model training. Multiple models are implemented and tested, and the results are analyzed. The dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, and using a virtual environment is recommended to run the files. Always run the `main.py` file from the respective competition folder.

**Modify the data file location as needed.**

### Enhancements to be Added

```
- Make a JSON file for path handling
- Use a library to detect the OS type
- Add error handling
- Implement a function for printing
```
